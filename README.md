### Setup instructions - includes any scripts that need to be run if necessary.
To view the app, open the Github Pages link provided below on the README. Here is a run through of how to set up the application

- Step 1 : Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/Vyvnn/week2_IP.git, or downloading a ZIP file of the code.
- Step 2 : The repository, if downloaded as a .zip file will need to be extracted to your preferred location and opened
- Step 3 : Open the index.html file to view the application on your preferred web browser


### BDD.
The application should output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender. For example, if a user is male and the result of the calculation is 0, then the application should match that with Kwasi since Kwasi corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output the user will see should be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”



It check whether the date and month entered is valid. if either of them is invalid,  the output user should be alerted and asked to enter a birth date  i.e"Please pick your birthdate" .when a user selects gender before the day of birth,they will be prompted with the same alert message. 

Also if a valid date is selected and no gender selected,the output user is alerted and asked to select a gender i.e "Please pick your gender" .
